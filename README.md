# BicycleBloom

<b>In the year 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic brought about a dramatic increase in bicycle sales in response. Heightened anxiety over public transportation and a surge in exercise enabled more people opt for one of the most basic forms of mobility, leading to a so-called “bike boom” with a 54.82% and 28.02% change realized in bikers and pedestrians respectively from 2019 to 2020.</b>
